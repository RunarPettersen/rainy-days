Rainy Days was our first assignment at Noroff focused on learning JavaScript.

## Description

The main task was to create a functioning shopping system where users could add products to a shopping cart, adjust the cart, and complete a checkout process. We were given the option to continue working on our very first project or choose one of the other two options and start from scratch. I chose to start fresh, as I felt it offered more learning opportunities by building it from the ground up.</p><p>For this assignment, everything from the logo to the products was pre-designed. However, I was free to customize the logo to my liking and select a color scheme to build the overall design around.
